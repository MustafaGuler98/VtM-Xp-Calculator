# Vampire: The Masquerade - Community XP Calculator

A C# command-line tool to automate starting XP calculation for the Alacakaranlýkta Ýstanbul PBP community.


## About The Project

This project is a utility tool designed specifically for the **Vampire: The Masquerade** Play-by-Post (PBP) role-playing
community at [**alacakaranliktaistanbul.com**](https://alacakaranliktaistanbul.com/forum).

It automates and standardizes the calculation of starting experience points (XP) based on the forum's custom-balanced ruleset.
The goal is to provide a fair, consistent, and easy-to-use tool for both new and existing players during character creation.


## Ruleset Philosophy & Mechanics

For those familiar with the official TTRPG, our system is heavily inspired by the **Vampire: The Masquerade 20th Anniversary 
Edition (V20)** experience system, adapted to fit the long-form narrative style of our Play-by-Post game.

Key mechanics integrated into this calculator and our game include:

*   **XP Usage:** In our chronicle, the starting XP calculated by this tool is used exclusively for purchasing Disciplines, 
Combination Powers, and Rituals.
*   **Ritual Costs:** The cost for Rituals follows a simple formula: `Ritual Level x 2 XP`.
*   **Storyteller Discretion:** Storytellers (STs) reserve the right to apply a discretionary **+20% Plot Bonus** to the final XP
total to reflect a character's unique background or deep integration into the chronicle's plot.
*   **Attribute Adjudication:** The non-numeric, character-driven stats used by the calculator (such as *Talent* and *Work
Discipline*) are determined by the Storyteller team, often in consultation with the player, to best reflect the character's 
narrative and background.
